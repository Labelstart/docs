title: Custom actions
---

You can create custom actions which will trigger a webhook with a custom event type and payload based on the selected action type, such as `releases`, `tracks`, or `external_users`.

## Create a custom action

To create a custom action, go to the **Integrations** page in the **Settings** section of your account. Click **Add action** and set the type, event, and a descriptor of the action you want to create. When a custom action is triggered, a webhook will be sent to all the webhooks that you have set up in your organization.

## Using custom actions

Learn how to use custom actions in your organization by reading the [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) documentation.
