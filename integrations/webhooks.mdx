title: Webhooks
---

You can use webhooks to receive notifications about events that happen in your account. For example, you can use webhooks to receive notifications when a release is created, edited, or deleted.

## Creating a webhook

To create a webhook, go to the **Integrations** page in the **Settings** section of your account. Click **Add webhook** and enter the name and URL of the webhook you want to create.

## Configuring a webhook

It's currently not possible to choose which events you want to receive notifications for. You will receive notifications for all events that are supported by the webhook.

## Deleting a webhook

To delete a webhook, go to the **Integrations** page in the **Settings** section of your account. Click the **Delete webhook** button next to the webhook you want to delete.

## Webhook payload

The payload of a webhook is a JSON object that contains information about the event that triggered the webhook. The payload will contain the following fields:

- `token`: A unique identifier for the webhook that can be used to verify the authenticity of the webhook.
- `type`: The type of event that triggered the webhook, such as `release.created`, `release.updated`, or `release.deleted`.
- `request`: The payload of the request that triggered the webhook, such as metadata of the release that was created, updated, or deleted.

Here is an example of a webhook payload:

```json

    "token": "xxxxxx",
    "type": "release.created",
    "request": {
        "data": {

## Verifying a webhook

To verify the authenticity of a webhook, you can send a `POST` request to the URL of the webhook with the `token` field of the payload as a POST field. The webhook should respond with a `200 OK` status code if the `token` is valid or a `401 Unauthorized` status code if the `token` is invalid.

Here is an example of how to verify a webhook using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -d '{"token": "abc"}' https://api.labelst.art/webhook/verify
```
